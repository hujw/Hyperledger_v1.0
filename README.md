# Hyperledger_v1.0

Hyperledger is a block-chain system which is developed by IBM. We use it to do our research in block-chain topic. The configuration files below are the important parts in this system.

  - The file "core.yaml" is used for "peer"
  
  - The file "orderer.yaml" is used for "orderer"
  
  - The file "configtx.yaml" defines how many organizations will join the channel. The system will use the information in this file to generate the channel.
